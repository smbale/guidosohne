Downloading

If you want to download your app from Appengine be warned that this Google documentation at https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/uploadinganapp#Downloading_an_Application has the <download_app> arguement in the wrong place.

./appengine-java-sdk/bin/appcfg.sh download_app -A <your_app_id> -V <your_app_version> <output-dir> 

It should be 

./appengine-java-sdk/bin/appcfg.sh -A <your_app_id> -V <your_app_version> download_app <output-dir>
